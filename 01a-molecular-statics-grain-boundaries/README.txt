We can already use molecular statics to compute some thermodynamic
properties of grain boundaries at 0K.

See Frolov and Mishin, Phys. Rev. B 85, 224107 (2012) for details on
the theory.

Running the simulation
======================

Read the "lmp.in" file and add any missing values. Run the simulation.

This should give you the grain boundary energy and stress.

Grain boundary excess volume
============================
