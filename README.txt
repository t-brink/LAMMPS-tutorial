This is a tutorial for LAMMPS <https://lammps.org>. Just go through
all directories in order, starting by reading the README.txt and
following the instructions.

There are also additional tutorials that are optional. You can skip
them if they do not sound interesting. Or revisit them later. The
optional tutorials are indicated by a two-digit number followed by a
letter. Step 02a, for example, assumes that step 1 and 2 have been
done.

For the best effect, look into every file and play around. Always keep
the LAMMPS documentation at hand and refer to it. It is an excellent
reference, but sadly not so good to get you started. Hence this
tutorial.
