This is a tutorial for LAMMPS <https://lammps.sandia.gov>. Just go
through all directories in order, starting by reading the README.txt
and following the instructions.

For the best effect, look into every file and play around. Always keep
the LAMMPS documentation at hand and refer to it. It is an excellent
reference, but sadly not so good to get you started. Hence this
tutorial.
