# Physics of the system ################################################

# Instead of creating the input file externally with ASE, we can also
# use LAMMPS itself to create the structure. Which one to use is a
# matter of taste and of the specific capabilities of the tools used
# to create the simulations. For a simple simulation cell with fcc
# atoms it doesn't matter much. I personally find the command below
# hard to remember compared to the ASE script.
#
# First, we need to define a crystal lattice and its lattice constant:
lattice            fcc 4.0
# Then, we need to tell LAMMPS how many unit cells to produce in each
# direction. This is done with a region. Here, we want 10x10x10 (cubic)
# unit cells. The region will also define the simulation cell.
region             boxregion block 0 10  0 10  0 10
# Then we actually create the box and the atoms. The number in the
# create_box command defines how many different atom types we have in
# this simulation (here only one). The number in the create_atoms
# command tells it which atom type the created atoms should have. The
# argument "box" simply means to fill the whole box. The command
# automatically uses the defined lattice.

# For dynamics, we need a time integration algorithm. This here is the

# else and can omit this option if we like.

# In addition to the other settings, molecular dynamics is a numeric
# time integration with discrete time steps. We need to choose a time
# step length that is not too big, otherwise the numerical errors will
# be too big. But if the time step is too small, our simulation will
# take longer. We need to find a compromise.
#
# Rigorous determination of an optimal time step is outside the scope
# of this tutorial. Some rules of thumb are to use something on the
# order of 1 fs for simulations with realistic atoms. Some people say
# this should be around 1/100 of a typical vibrational period, so it
# must be smaller for lighter elements.

# Run ##################################################################

# While we set the style of the time integration further up
# ("run_style"), the actual time integration will only be performed if
# a fix that implements integration is applied.
#
# With this fix, we can also choose the thermodynamic ensemble in
# which our simulation lives. Classical molecular dynamics uses
# Newtonian mechanics and the forces of the potentials are
# conservative, meaning a simple implementation of MD will be in the
# microcanonical or NVE ensemble. This is provided in the aptly-named
# "nve" fix.

# The input file we use has all atom velocities set to zero. This will
# be quite a boring simulation, so we intialize the velocities
# according to a Maxwellâ€“Boltzmann distribution appropriate for T = 300K.
# Luckily, LAMMPS has a command for that.
#
# The last number is a random seed. Change it to obtain a different,
# statistically equivalent, initial distribution of velocities.

# Now that we have set up the fixes and inserted some kinetic energy
# into the system, we can start the simulation. We just need to
# provide the number of time steps we want to perform. Multiply this
# number by the length of a single time step to obtain the physical
# time this corresponds to.
